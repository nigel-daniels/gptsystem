In prompt engineering things go faster so taking time to build out test sets
is an extra load on the development time, hence test sets tend to be built
incrementally.

- Tune prompts on a handful of examples. (a handful of prompts)
- Add additional 'tricky' examples opportunistically.
- Develop metrics to measure performance on examples. E.g. ave. accuracy
- Collect randomly sampled sets of examples to tune to. (Only if the previous did not work or fidelity is low)
 	(development set/hold-out cross validation set) [This can take accuracy from 90% further]
- Collect and use a hold-out set. [Only for high-risk such as bias or harm]

The code examples look at the first three steps and looks at quantitative testing.
